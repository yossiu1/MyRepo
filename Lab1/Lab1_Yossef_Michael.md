[Exploitation of CLFS zero-day leads to ransomware activity \| Microsoft
Security
Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/08/exploitation-of-clfs-zero-day-leads-to-ransomware-activity/)

***[Schema Description]{.underline}*:**

An adversary group exploited a zero‑day kernel vulnerability in the
Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) to escalate from a standard user
to system privileges. It hasn\'t been determined what initial access
vectors led to the devices being compromised by adversary group but
afterwards, [they delivered a malicious MSBuild payload downloaded via
*[certutil]{.underline}*]{.mark}, [used the CLFS exploit]{.mark} to
[overwrite a process token]{.mark} and [inject into high‑privilege
processes]{.mark}, [dumped LSASS memory with *[procdump]{.underline}* to
harvest credentials]{.mark}, [and then deployed ransomware that deleted
backups]{.mark}, [cleared event logs]{.mark} and [encrypted files
(ransom note !\_READ_ME_REXX2\_!.txt)]{.mark}.

***[Tactics, Techniques and Behaviors]{.underline}*:**

- **[Command and Control]{.mark}: T1105 --- Ingress Tool Transfer.\**
  Observation: The adversaries used certutil to download an MSBuild file
  (hosted on a compromised third‑party site) that contained an encrypted
  payload.

- **[Defense Evasion]{.mark}: T1140 --- Deobfuscate/Decode Files or
  Information\**
  Observation: The downloaded MSBuild file contained an encrypted
  payload that was decoded/processed at runtime (MSBuild + certutil used
  to deliver and activate the payload).

<!-- -->

- **[Defense Evasion]{.mark}: T1211 --- Exploitation for Defense
  Evasion\**
  Observation: The exploit targets a vulnerability in the CLFS kernel
  driver. It's notable that the exploit first uses the
  *NtQuerySystemInformation* API to leak kernel addresses to user mode.

- **[Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation]{.mark}: T1134 --- Access
  Token Manipulation\**
  Observation: The exploit overwrote the process token (article notes
  token bits set to 0xFFFFFFFF), effectively granting full privileges to
  the process - matching access‑token manipulation/impersonation
  behaviors.

<!-- -->

- **[Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation]{.mark}: T1055 --- Process
  Injection (and sub-techniques)\**
  Observation: After exploitation, the attackers injected into
  winlogon.exe (process injection / in‑memory techniques) to execute in
  a high‑privilege context.

<!-- -->

- **[Credential Access]{.mark}: T1003.001 --- OS Credential Dumping:
  LSASS Memory\**
  Observation: The threat actors used procdump.exe to dump LSASS memory
  to harvest credentials (Sysinternals procdump -ma lsass.exe).

<!-- -->

- **[Impact]{.mark}: T1490 --- Inhibit System Recovery\**
  Observation: Commands recorded include deleting backup catalogs
  (*[wbadmin]{.underline}* delete catalog -quiet) and disabling recovery
  options - typical ransomware behavior to prevent restoration.

- **[Defense Evasion]{.mark}: T1070.001 --- Indicator Removal: Clear
  Windows Event Logs\**
  Observation: The actors ran *[wevtutil]{.underline}* cl Application to
  clear event logs and remove forensic evidence.

- **[Impact]{.mark}: T1486 --- Data Encrypted for Impact\**
  Observation: The campaign included file encryption and placement of a
  ransom note (!\_READ_ME_REXX2\_!.txt), consistent with ransomware
  impact techniques.
